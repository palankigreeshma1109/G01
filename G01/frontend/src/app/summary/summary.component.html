      The chart titled <strong>"AI Diagnostic Error Reduction Over Time"</strong> shows how AI is helping to reduce diagnostic errors. Over time, the use of AI in medical diagnostics has gotten better, with fewer mistakes being made. This happens because AI can process lots of medical data quickly and learn from it. The chart seems to suggest that as AI gets more data and experience, it makes fewer errors. This is important because AI can help doctors make better decisions, especially in places where doctors are scarce. The chart is likely showing that over time, AI tools are becoming more accurate and helpful, which could lead to fewer diagnostic mistakes in the future.
