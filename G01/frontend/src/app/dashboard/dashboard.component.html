      Technical Aspects
    </h3>
    <p>
      This project is built using a robust tech stack to ensure a responsive and scalable web application. The frontend is developed with Angular (v18.2.11), leveraging its modular architecture, two-way data binding, and rich component library for creating a dynamic Single Page Application (SPA). The backend is fully decoupled, communicating with the frontend via HTTP calls using RESTful APIs, ensuring a clean separation of concerns. Authentication is implemented using JWT (JSON Web Token), providing a secure mechanism for managing user sessions. The application is styled with CSS and integrates Angular Material for consistent UI/UX components, such as the navigation bar, forms, and snackbar notifications.
      The infrastructure includes a Node.js backend, supported by a MongoDB database for efficient and flexible data management. The application follows a component-based architecture, ensuring reusability and maintainability of the codebase. It is hosted on cloud platforms (e.g., AWS or Azure) for reliability, with CI/CD pipelines ensuring smooth deployment and updates. Additionally, form validations and real-time feedback mechanisms improve user experience. The project prioritizes best practices, including responsive design and modular development, making it scalable and maintainable for future enhancements.
